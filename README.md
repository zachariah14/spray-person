# Spray-Person

Angular JS front end with REST api powered by Spray.  Typesafe Activator template created by Credera

## Running Spray-Person

Start the application with `activator run` (or `sbt run`, same thing).

Navigate to the home page [http://localhost:8080/index.html](http://localhost:8080/index.html) to see the Angular app

Or do a GET request to [http://localhost:8080/api/person](http://localhost:8080/api/person) to hit the REST endpoint directly

## Front End Development

The `\dist` directory has been included in the project and is already built including minification.
	Running the server will serve the app from here so that it runs out of the box.  Any changes you make in here will get clobbered next time
 you build the front end with grunt.  Normally this folder is not included in source control.

For front end development make your changes to the `\app` folder and follow the steps below:

## Front End Setup

Front end requires Bower, which requires npm

### Install NPM:
But this is an scala app and I already have SBT!!  For the front end dependency management you will need npm.

Options
- https://www.npmjs.org/doc/README.html
- `brew install npm`

### Install bower
Bower is a front end dependency manager `npm install -g bower` (Linux users might have to run with sudo)

Download all the front end dependencies with `bower install`

*They will be in your `app\bower_components` directory as instructed by `.bowerrc`*

### Install Grunt CLI
Grunt is a front end task runner
`npm install -g grunt-cli`

Wire up the dependencies with `grunt bowerInstall`

*This modifies `app\index.html` to include your dependencies*


### Change where static content is served from

Lastly in `/src/main/scala/com/example/actors/routes/ApiRouterActor.scala` change where static content is served from:

		getFromResourceDirectory("dist")

		//becomes

		getFromResourceDirectory("app")
